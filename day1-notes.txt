started salesforce DevOps Journey - Day 1

🗓️ Day 1: Git & GitHub Setup – Salesforce DevOps Journey

✅ Installed Git and verified it using `git --version`
✅ Configured Git user name and email for commits
✅ Created my first GitHub repository: salesforce-devops-learning
✅ Cloned the repository to my local system using Git Bash
✅ Created a new file: day1-notes.txt
✅ Learned basic Git commands: add, commit, push
✅ Pushed my first file to GitHub from local repo
✅ Understood line-ending warning (LF/CRLF) and it's safe to ignore

🧠 Key Learnings:
- Git is used to track and manage changes in code
- GitHub is a remote repository to store and share your projects
- Committing = saving a version of your project with a message
- Pushing = sending your committed changes to GitHub
- First step toward DevOps version control is now clear!
